## How To Use?

Built files can be found in Action, stable version can be found in Release.

For each platform there are 2 different versions with and without additional parse function (`No Function`). Additional parse function can parse entity ID and synchronize protocol data etc.

After downloading:

For Windows, put file `mcdissector.dll` into parser directory of Wireshark (`plugins/4.0/epan`) and run Wireshark.

For Linux, put file `mcdissector.so` into parser directory of Wireshark (`plugins/4.0/epan`) and run Wireshark.

## Tunable Options

`MCJE` can be found in `Preferences/Protocols` in Wireshark, you can adjust some options here.

* Ignore Packets: To stop parsing some packets to filt unwanted information. The format is in lists separated by commas made up by `<s|c>:<packet_name>`. `s` represents packets sent to server, `c` represents packets sent to client. Default option `c:map_chunk` is to stop parsing server to client chunk data packets, since to parse such packets will spend extra long time and produce excess data fields.
* Secret Key: To encrypt connect keys for decrypting data. The format is in hexademical strings with length of 32.
* TCP Port(s): To change TCP ports used by MCJE protocol to identify protocol.

## Encrypted Connection

If you enter Minecraft servers in legitimated game client, encrypted connection will be built between server and client base on `AES/CFB8/NoPadding` algorithm.
This step will execute before compression during login. All data in the connection will be encrypted, including data length fields of spilted data.

To monitor data in encrypted connection, we need to know what a key is with the help of `encryption-helper` in the project.
By using the character that the generation of symmetric encrypted keys was executed by client, it forced client to generate a specified key to replace a random one.

`encryption-helper` is a Java Agent inject executive code dynamically when running Minecraft. It needs JVM parameters as follow to attach to a Minecraft client:

```shell
-javaagent:<document location>=<key>
```

The key is a hexademical string only contains 0-F with length of 32. If the input format is incorrect, crash will be reported immediately when starting client.

Theoretically, `encryption-helper` can run in all unobfuscated and obfuscated injectable clients, since the injection points it locates only contain features could not be obfuscated as follow:

* Method return value is `javax.crypto.SecretKey`.
* Method has no parameter.
* The type of the first local variable of the method is `javax.crypto.KeyGenerator`.

Very few mods modify logics here, so it's safe for the program to modify. It should not conflict with mods.

Only a single circumstance will disable the program: Mods have modified encryption logics here and resulted in failure in invoking and keys replacing.

## Parsing Errors

Parsing errors exists under 2 circumstances as follow:

* Wireshark failed to capture all data. Since Java version uses TCP, data is spilt by length field. Once missing anything, data will be unparsable immediately. You can confirm this circumstance if you have discovered error `TCP Previous segment not captured` near the data parsing error.
* The program has not finished adaption or corresponding treatments for this part or has not added corresponding strings. Such error can be reported as an Issue.

The overall protocol is built by protocol description dynamic file in `minecraft-data`. If you are convinced that error is caused by fault in protocol description, you can report Issue in `minecraft-data` warehouse.

## To Build Projects (Windows)

Building this project needs support from source code of Wireshark and dependency configuration, and python for code generation.

1. Clone Wireshark store to local and configure necessary dependencies.
2. Specify environment variable `PLATFORM` as `x64`, and `WIRESHARK_LIB_DIR` as directory of dependency library of Wireshark (automatically created at running cmake).
3. Create `build` in peer directory of Wireshark source codes, and run `cmake -A x64 .. -DBUILD_wireshark=OFF` in "build".
4. Still in "build", run `cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo --target epan`.
5. Specify environment variable `WIRESHARK_DIR` (directory of Wireshark source code), `WIRESHARK_BUILD_DIR` (location of directory of "build") and `WIRESHARK_LIB_FILE_DIR` (location of directory of RelWithDebInfo generated by building the project).
6. Run `cmake -S . -G Ninja -B build` in project root directory.
7. Run `cmake --build build --target MC_Dissector` in project root directory.
8. Built file can be discovered in "build" directory.

## To Build Projects (Linux)

It is much easier to build on Linux, read ci.yml for details. (Too lazy to write here)

## Current Plans

- [x] Almost complete! (Crash free, at least!ï¼‰
- [x] Linux support by @xtexChooser
- [x] Support encryption. (It should be OK!)
- [ ] Version compatibility.
- [ ] Support bedrock version.
